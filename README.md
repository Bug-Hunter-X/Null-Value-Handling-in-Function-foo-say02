# Null Value Handling Bug in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to null value handling in a JavaScript function. The function `foo` is expected to perform a specific operation, but it exhibits unexpected behavior when null values are passed as arguments.

The bug is difficult to identify because it only manifests under specific conditions. It is crucial to handle null and undefined values correctly to prevent unexpected errors and improve code robustness. 

## Bug Description

The `foo` function does not properly handle cases where `a` or `b` is null. This can lead to unexpected results or errors.

## Solution

The solution involves explicitly checking for null values before proceeding with the rest of the function's logic.  This ensures that the function behaves predictably regardless of the input values.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js`. This file contains the buggy code.
3. Run the code with different test cases, including some with null inputs.
4. Observe the unexpected behavior.
5. Now open `bugSolution.js` and you will see the correct implementation which addresses the issue.

This example showcases the importance of comprehensive null checks in JavaScript to ensure the reliability and stability of your applications.
